# USACO 2016 February Contest, Bronze: Problem 3 - Load Balancing

[Problem Link](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=617)

## Problem Description

Farmer John has N cows at distinct locations on a 2D farm. He wants to build two infinite fences: one vertical (x = a) and one horizontal (y = b), where both a and b are even integers. These fences partition the field into four regions.

The goal is to choose a and b to minimize M, the maximum number of cows in any single region. The coordinates are positive odd integers at most B.

## Input Format

- First line: two integers N and B
- Next N lines: x and y coordinates of each cow

## Output Format

A single integer representing the smallest possible value of M.
